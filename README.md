# AGC
AGC adds a garbage collector to your Ada programs.

## Usage

1. The sources of your project must be processed by AGC as a first step before
   you invoke gprbuild. Run
   ```
   agc -P <project_file.gpr> --output-dir <new-project-dir>
   ```
   This will generate a new set of sources in the directory specified by `<new-project-dir>`.
   
2. Then, you must write a new project file that can compile the set of generated sources.
   Typically (but not necessarily), this project file will be similar to that of your original project,
   but must include the AGC's runtime:
   ```
   with "<path-to-AGC>/lib/agc_runtime.gpr";
   ```
   Don't forget to rectify the relative paths appearing in the project file.
   
3. You can now invoke `gprbuild` on this new project file. The built binary will behave as your original program, but will benefit from garbage collection.

## Internals

The implementation is similar to any garbage collector:
1. Keep track of reachable memory locations
2. Keep track of heap allocated locations
3. Free heap allocated locations when they are not reachable

Unfortunately, 1. and 2. are not easily extractable from arbitrary Ada programs. Therefore, AGC chooses not to work with the original Ada code, but transforms it into a representation that allows it perform those two actions. AGC's frontend first transforms a source file of the following form:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Test is
   type Integer_Access is access all Integer;

   X : Integer_Access := null;
begin
   for I in 1 .. 10_000 loop
      X := new Integer'(42);
   end loop;
end Test;
```

Into this:

```ada
with GC;
with GC.Storage;
with System;
with Ada.Unchecked_Conversion;
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Test is
   pragma Default_Storage_Pool (GC.Storage.Pool);
   AGC_Base_Root_Count : Natural := GC.Root_Count;
   
   type Integer_Access is access all Integer;
   procedure AGC_Visit_Test_Integer_Access is new GC.Visit_Access_Type
     (Integer, Integer_Access, GC.No_Op);
     
   X : aliased Integer_Access := null;
begin
   GC.Push_Root (X'Address, AGC_Visit_Test_Integer_Access'Address);
   for I in 1 .. 10_000 loop
      X := new Integer'(42);
   end loop;
   GC.Pop_Roots (AGC_Base_Root_Count);
end Test;

```

As you can see, roots are explicited to the garbage collector through calls to `GC.Push_Root`. The example above shows it working for stack-allocated variables, but this must also include global variables (_not yet implemented_). Note that all stack-allocated variables are now marked `aliased`: this is because we are taking their address which in Ada is only necessarily meaningful for aliased objects (see RM 13.3.16).

AGC must sometime do heavy manipulation to track all reachable locations. In particular, temporary results such as values returned from function calls must be registered in the garbage collector although they are not reachable by a source code variable. This is done by reshaping the code to store them explicitly in temporary variables. For example:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Test is
   type Integer_Access is access all Integer;

   function Incr (X : Integer_Access) return Integer_Access is
   begin
     return new Integer'(X.all + 1);
   end Incr;
begin
   Put_Line (Incr (new Integer'(1)).all'Image);
end Test;
```

Is expanded to:

```ada
with GC;
with GC.Storage;
with System;
with Ada.Unchecked_Conversion;
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Test is
   pragma Default_Storage_Pool (GC.Storage.Pool);
   AGC_Base_Root_Count : Natural := GC.Root_Count;
   
   type Integer_Access is access all Integer;
   procedure AGC_Visit_Test_Integer_Access is new GC.Visit_Access_Type
     (Integer, Integer_Access, GC.No_Op);
     
   function Incr (X : Integer_Access) return Integer_Access is
   begin
      return new Integer'(X.all + 1);
   end Incr;
begin
   declare
      AGC_Temp_1 : aliased Test.Integer_Access := new Integer'(1);
   begin
      GC.Push_Root (AGC_Temp_1'Address, AGC_Visit_Test_Integer_Access'Address);
      declare
         AGC_Temp_0 : aliased Test.Integer_Access := Incr (AGC_Temp_1);
      begin
         GC.Push_Root
           (AGC_Temp_0'Address, AGC_Visit_Test_Integer_Access'Address);
         Put_Line (AGC_Temp_0.all'Image);
      end;
   end;
   GC.Pop_Roots (AGC_Base_Root_Count);
end Test;
```

To see why this is necessary, assume for a moment that the GC was running on the original program. Now if we suppose that the allocation inside `Incr` triggers a garbage collection, then the temporary value `new Integer'(1)` allocated in `Test`'s body would be collected because it's not reachable by any root, neither directly or indirectly. Thanks to the transformation, a temporary variable `AGC_Temp_1` is generated and holds its result while `Incr` is being called.

Additionally, you may have observed the presence of `AGC_Visit_[...]` procedures in the generated code. Those are automatically derived for types that the GC must be aware of, which are basically all types that are either access types or than contain access types directly or indirectly. These are used by the GC's runtime to browse the entire space of reachable locations starting from the program's roots whenever a collection is triggered. This allows keeping alive memory that is indirectly reachable by a root of the program.
