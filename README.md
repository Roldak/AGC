# AGC
AGC adds a garbage collector to your Ada programs.

## Usage

1. The sources of your project must be processed by AGC as a first step before
   you invoke gprbuild. Run
   ```
   agc -P <project_file.gpr> --output-dir <new-project-dir>
   ```
   This will generate a new set of sources in the directory specified by `<new-project-dir>`.
   
2. Then, you must write a new project file that can compile the set of generated sources.
   Typically (but not necessarily), this project file will be similar to that of your original project,
   but must include the AGC's runtime:
   ```
   with "<path-to-AGC>/lib/agc_runtime.gpr";
   ```
   Don't forget to rectify the relative paths appearing in the project file.
   
3. You can now invoke `gprbuild` on this new project file. The built binary will behave as your original program, but will benefit from garbage collection.

## Internals

The implementation is similar to any garbage collector:
1. keep track of reachable memory locations
2. keep track of heap allocated locations
3. free heap allocated locations when they are not reachable

Unfortunately, 1. and 2. are not easily extractable from Ada programs. Therefore, AGC chooses not to work with the original Ada code, but transforms it into a representation that allows it perform those two actions: AGC's frontend first transforms a source file of the following form:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Test is
   type Integer_Access is access all Integer;

   X : Integer_Access := null;
begin
   for I in 1 .. 10_000 loop
      X := new Integer'(42);
   end loop;
end Test;
```

Into this:

```ada
with GC;
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Test is
   type Integer_Access is access all Integer;
   
   X : aliased Integer_Access := null;
begin
   GC.Push_Reachable (X'Address);
   for I in 1 .. 10_000 loop
      X := GC.Register (0, new Integer'(42));
      GC.Untemp (0);
   end loop;
   GC.Pop_Reachable (1);
end Test;
```

As you can see:

1. Roots are explicited to the garbage collector through calls to `GC.Push_Reachable`. The example above shows it working for stack-allocated variables, but this must also include global variables. Note that all stack-allocated variables are now marked `aliased`: this is because we are taking their address which is only meaningful for aliased objects in Ada ().
2. Heap allocations are wrapped in calls to `GC.Register`, in order for the GC to track them. Additionally, note the calls to `GC.Untemp` right after allocation sites: this is because upon allocation, the allocated memory cannot be considered reachable by the GC as no root can reach it yet, which means they could be free'd by the GC instantly if another expression from the same statement triggers a collection before the memory location can be assigned to a variable. So, those are initially marked _temporary_ which signifies that they cannot be collected even though they are not reachable by the GC. Then, calls to `GC.Untemp` make sure to remove this flag once the statement in which the allocation occurs is completed.
